It looks good when invoking as a script, but not when using -m:
#+begin_src shell
  (example-copier-python) c:\proj\copier\example-copier-python>python -m my_example_project
  usage: __main__.py [-h] [-v] [-q]

  options:
    -h, --help     show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose  Increase verbosity (debug level) by one.
    -q, --quiet    Decrease verbosity (debug level) by one.
  Invoked with Namespace(log_level='WARNING', action=None)
#+end_src
